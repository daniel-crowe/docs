    The transaction query options object `GraknOptions` can be used to override the default server behaviour
    query processing.

    The server defaults are:
    - `infer = true` (note: only settable at transaction level)
    - `explain = false`
    - `batchSize = 50`

    The transaction query optional parameters can be used to override the default server behaviour for query processing.

    The server defaults are:
    - `infer = True` (note: only settable at transaction level)
    - `explain = False`
    - `batch_size = 50`

    `batch_size` tells the server to pre-compute and stream this number of answers at a time. These are buffered in the
    client until read. A larger batch size causes the server to compute more answers at a time, blocking the transaction
    until the batch is computed.

    The transaction query options Object can be used to override the default server behaviour for query processing.
    We can provide any of the allowed keys: `infer`, `explain`, and `batchSize`.

    The server defaults are:
    - `infer = true` (note: only settable at transaction level)
    - `explain = false`
    - `batchSize = 50`

    `batchSize` tells the server to pre-compute and stream this number of answers at a time. These are buffered in the
    client until read. A larger batch size causes the server to compute more answers at a time, blocking the transaction
    until the batch is computed.
